# REVERSI/AI

Reversi, also known as Othello, is a popular 2-player board game in which players arrange pieces on a grid. The goal is to finish with more pieces of our colour than opponentâ€™s colour on the board. 

In this project, we implemented an AI player for the Reversi game using a popular technique Alpha-Beta pruning of the Min-Max algorithm. This algorithm is well known to be used in determining the best possible move to win by evaluating all possible outcomes. By using the Alpha-Beta pruning of the Min-Max algorithm, we can significantly reduce the number of evaluations required to determine the best possible move, making the AI player more efficient and effective. 

This project showcases what we will and have been learning in the AI subject, and it will also demonstrate how effective Alpha-Beta pruning is in optimising decision based problems.
